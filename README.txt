Group 38: Prison Break

In the module of CS-230, we were tasked with making a game similar to the Windows arcade game named "Jewel Chase".

Our idea for our specific group was to put a prison based theme on our images. Our game should follow the
specification to the letter however this theme is applied all throughout our program.

Compilation:

Our code can be easily compiled by compiling all the classes under the src/main/java/com/group38/prisonbreak directory,
in our group we did this using the IntelliJ IDE, and we have maven to include JavaFX for us.

Running our code:

Our code can be easily ran by running "Game.java", which interacts with our FXML to put you on the main menu of the game.
